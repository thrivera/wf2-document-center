# About Us

## Why we created Wunderfund

People are really excited about fast-growing new companies, whether they are breweries, tech startups, fast casual restaurants, or new software apps. They're creating beautiful products, transforming neighborhoods, creating jobs, and revitalizing the economy. In the heart of America's Great Midwest, there are as many as 50,000 startups like these with a great story to tell.

The problem is that many of them need capital, and it's getting harder to raise funding, whether it be from banks, angels, or institutions. The bottom line is that there isn't enough capital accessible to them.

That's why we started the Wunderfund, to make it easy for startups to raise money through the power of crowd investors. Up until last year, only the richest Americans could invest in startups, but today ushers in a new era. Today, we're democratizing startup investing so the general public can diversify into startups too.

We look for companies that communities want to rally around, products that resonate with many people, and brands that tell a great story. For entrepreneurs who dream and startups that wonder, it's time to raise capital. It's time to Wunderfund!
