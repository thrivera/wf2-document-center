# Privacy Policy

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES

Thrivera Ventures Fund I, LLC (d/b/a Wunderfund) ("Wunderfund" or "we"), recognizes the importance of the individual privacy or each user of our services (individually, "you" or a "User" and collectively, "Users"). This Privacy Policy outlines the types of Personally Identifying Information ("PII") Thrivera gathers when you use any website, application, or other online service made available by Thrivera under this Privacy Policy (each a "Service"), and how we use that information. This Privacy Policy also details the steps we take to safeguard your PII and how you can correct or update the PII gathered. It is important to review this Privacy Policy in its entirety.

## Information We Collect

_Information you provide to Wunderfund_. "Personally Identifying Information" is information that individually identifies you, and may include your name, physical address, phone number, email address, date of birth, net worth, income, status as an accredited investor, employer identification number, social security number, and any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact you. Of course, you may choose not to provide Wunderfund with Personally Identifying Information. However, this choice may prevent Wunderfund from providing you with the information or Services you requested or that could be offered to you.

If you invest in a business through the Services, we will collect payment information from you, such as financial account information or payment card information, and we may collect information to verify your income.

If you would like to raise funding for your business with our Services, we collect information about you and your business, your fundraising terms, and payment information.

_Third-Party Services_. If you register for the Services through a third-party social networking or authentication services (a "Credential Party"), such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, we will collect Personally Identifying Information that you have provided to the Credential Party (such as your name, email address, photo, and other information you make available via the Credential Party) and an authentication token from the Credential Party. The Personally Identifying Information collected from the Credential party may be used to register you on the Services. You may revoke our access to your account with a Credential Party at any time by updating the appropriating settings in the account preferences of the respective Credential Party. You understand that certain features of the Services may not be available to you if you choose to remove our access to your account with the Credential Party.

_Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services_. When you access or use the Services, we may automatically collect information about you, including:

_Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies_. Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences. One such technology is called a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Services. Also, we may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can recognize you and customize your experience based on your preferences. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or to prompt you before accepting such a cookie. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject browser cookies, this could affect the availability or functionality of the Services. We may also use web beacons as part of the Services.

## Public Forum

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose any PII in a public forum available on the Services, this information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Privacy Policy does not apply to such information. You accept that you, and not Wunderfund, are responsible for providing such information in any public forum. Any submissions to public areas on the Services are accepted by you with the understanding that such forums are accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your comments or any content to be viewed by third parties, you should not submit comments or contents on public forums.

## Safeguards

Wunderfund has implemented information security safeguards designed to protect your PII. Unfortunately, neither the network nor data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect a User's information, Wunderfund cannot ensure or warrant the security of PII or other information submitted through a Service. Thus, any information a User transmits to us is done so at the User's own risk.

## Online Tracking

The Services do not respond to Do Not Track signals. Third parties cannot collect PII about you when you use a Service.

## Accountability and Compliance

You may address any question regarding how Wunderfund complies with this Privacy Policy to the e-mail address set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Third-Party Websites

On occasion, the Services are connected by "hyperlinks" to other third party's websites. Please note that Wunderfund is not responsible in any way for the privacy practices of other websites and suggests that you review the privacy policies of those other companies' websites before using them.

## Accessing/Updating Your Personally Identifying Information

You can access your information in your account profile settings, as well as during investment checkout. You can update the information you provided us in these settings as well. Your profile will always be hidden from public view as well as search engines that collect information from our websites. Information will be publicly shown only in a public forum where communication between you and the Issuer has been established on the homepage of this site. If you are within the EU, we can provide you a copy of your personal records we hold on this site and your communications with the Issuer.

You also have the right to ask Wunderfund to correct any information regarding your PII on Agreements, Third Party Services we use, or information saved in our database.

You have the right to delete certain account information through your profile settings. If you intend to delete your account altogether, we will permanently delete your account information and moments and we will delete your messages according to our regular retention schedule. Please note that we will continue to store certain information for analytics purposes, but that information will not include your personal information such as name, email address, or telephone number. Also, please note any information disclosed on the Public Forum will not be deleted, as per our requirements to comply with FINRA regulations. We will also retain any other information as required by law.

## Social Media Features and Widgets

The Services include social media features and widgets. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting through the Services, other applicable information, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media functions are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly through the Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

## Minors

The Services are not intended for people under the age of 13. Further, we do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed PII to us, please contact us at the e-mail address set forth in this Privacy Policy and Wunderfund will delete such PII.

## Consent to Transfer

Please be aware that information we collect through the Service may be transferred to and processed in the United States, where the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen. By using the Services or providing Wunderfund with any information, you consent to transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States or such other countries as Wunderfund choose in its sole discretion.

If you are within the EU, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your PII in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use by agreeing to our terms.
