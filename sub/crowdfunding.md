# What is Crowdfunding?

## What is equity crowdfunding and how is it different from traditional crowdfunding?

Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people via the Internet. There are essentially two types of crowdfunding platforms. The first type of crowdfunding platform offers products or rewards in exchange for your funding commitment (e.g. Kickstarter). The second type, which is how Wunderfund.co operates, allows individuals to invest in a startup company in exchange for a percentage share (or equity) in that company; or a promised return on investment. This fundraising method was legalized by the JOBS Act Title III.

## How is equity crowdfunding different from typical venture financing?

Equity Crowdfunding allows 'unaccredited' investors to directly invest in start-up businesses in return for an investment instrument from the business. Venture Capitalists are considered 'accredited' investors who can invest large amounts of money directly with start-up businesses. While the amount of money 'accredited' and 'unaccredited' investors are allowed to invest in start-ups varies, because of Crowdfunding, both have access to similar investment offerings.

## How does this work? Where do I start?

There are 3 simple steps: Apply, Build a Campaign and Launch. The first step is to fill out our application to make sure that you are cleared to start fundraising. Our assessment of this form can take from 7 – 10 business days. Meanwhile, you can start building out your campaign page in a few easy steps. Once you are cleared, you’re ready to launch!

## When am I ready to start fundraising?

We recommend that if you fundraise on Wunderfund.co you set a minimum of $25,000 and you are already beyond the idea stage. It is beneficial to have a prototype built, have paying customers and a complete business plan with all your financial documents already complete. You can refer to the Fundraising Checklist for more information. For now, you can create a free profile, and start collecting followers!

## What kind of businesses can fund on Wunderfund.co?

All types of startups are welcome including lifestyle businesses, restaurants, local breweries, distilleries, even software and hardware businesses. What’s important though, is that you have a product or service that has massive consumer appeal. Check out this guide for more info.

## How long does it take to get the money?

Once you launch a campaign, it can take 30-90 days for the campaign to be open, with the average being 60 days and minimum number of 30 days. All funds will be held in escrow until your campaign closes. We then have the funds wired to your corporate account within 7 days after your campaign is successful.

## If I raise money via crowdfunding now, will it hinder me from raising venture capital later on?

You should not have issues in future financing rounds. The Wunderfund.co uses a Crowdfunding agreement that proxies all voting rights to the CEO and the lead investors (i.e. the ones who've invested over a threshold designated by the CEO). We also give buy-back rights to your company if you do secure venture capital financing in the future. With these measures in place, you can maintain clean cap tables for VCs.

## What investment contracts and terms can I use?

We can structure the fund offerings with various types of securities. Our standard offerings include: a loan, revenue share loan, priced stock, or SAFE. But if you prefer to use your own lawyer and terms, you can also upload that for use. If you have special terms arranged with a larger investor who wants to participate in this round, we would recommend that it is already agreed to before building an online campaign.
